Currently in development.

ShelfLife or Siftor (tbd) is a better market place for books.
There are thousands of books lost in silent thrift shops
and dusty attics each day, and with this application they can be
organized and brought back to life. In the final version users
will be able to hover their mobile phone cameras over a bookshelf
and use the power of artificial intelligence to create a library
in a matter of seconds and share their collections with the world.
